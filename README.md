Of course, our connect four is going to have a slight twist! We will support the traditional, 6 x 7 board
with connecting four horizontally, diagonally, and vertically, but we will also support an n x m board with
connecting p pieces. You will take these values as command-line arguments with these options? r, ?c, and ?p
to indicate rows, columns, and pieces, and these option/value pairs can be provided in any order. You need
to make sure you handle inappropriate data, i.e.
non-positive integers, and ask the user again for the correct input. You do not have to recoverfrom bad
options. You must continue to play the game, until the user no longer wants to play, without creating a
memory leak!
